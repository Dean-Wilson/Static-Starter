# Static-Starter
This is a static starter template that uses Gulp. Best used for holding pages/one pagers and is a continuous WIP.

### Get started
- Clone into your directory
- Change package.json details to suit your project
- Open your terminal and `cd` to the directory
- Run `npm install` then `gulp`

### Notes
- Will need Node/npm and the Gulp CLI installed
